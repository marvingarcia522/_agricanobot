                            <p>Farmers lose an estimated average of 37% of their rice crop to pests and diseases every year. In addition to good crop management, timely and accurate diagnosis can significantly reduce losses. .</p>

                            <h2>The best control for pests and disease problems is prevention. To limit pest and disease damage:</h2>
                            <h3>Step 1</h3>
                            <p>Diseases can be spread between fields or between seasons if you do not take proper precautions. After harvest, be sure to clean the harvesting equipment to prevent the spread of infected plants..</p>
                            <p>Some diseases can live on the stubble between seasons and infect a healthy planted crop. In general, plowing after harvest removes stubble that serves as remaining food and shelter for pests, especially insects.. .</p>
                            <p>Clean the bunds and patch all rat holes on bunds and around your field. If there are nearby fallow fields or forested areas, you may want to have a community rat control effort or put up trap barriers to keep rats from damaging
                                your crop</p>

                            <h3>Step 2</h3>
                            <p>Certified seed is recommended but if you can't get certified seed, use clean seed that does not have any discolored seeds, weed seeds or other rice varieties mixed in.</p>
                            <p>Use short-duration and resistant cultivars to decrease insect pest populations. In short-duration cultivars, insects cannot compete as many generations, so populations may not reach damaging levels. Resistant varieties experience
                                less feeding damage on their leaves and stems, which means less entry points for bacteria and fungal diseases.</p>
